# Hello-World

Hi Everyone!
I'm just doing this to appease the tutorial gods but while I'm here I might as well share. I'm getting into the coding world because I consistantly see how incredible and useful technology can be. While the majority of us think modern technology is so easy to use, there are others who have disabilities that it doesn't accomidate. I want to contribute to rise of accessible technology for EVERYONE.
